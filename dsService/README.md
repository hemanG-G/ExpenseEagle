# dsService Tracker Service

## Overview

This service is part of the Expense Tracker application, responsible for processing and handling expense-related data. It accepts incoming HTTP POST requests, processes the data using a custom service, and produces messages to a Kafka topic. This setup allows the application to handle expense tracking in a scalable and distributed manner.

## Features

-   **Flask Framework:** Lightweight and efficient web server for handling API requests.
-   **Kafka Integration:** Produces processed expense data to a Kafka topic for further processing or storage.
-   **Custom Message Service:** Handles the business logic for processing expense data.
-   **Environment Configuration:** Uses environment variables for flexible configuration.

## Tech Stack

-   **Backend:** Flask (Python)
-   **Message Broker:** Apache Kafka
-   **Environment Management:** Python `dotenv`

## Prerequisites

Before running this microservice, ensure you have the following installed:

-   [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
-   [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/downloads)
-   [Zookeeper](https://zookeeper.apache.org/releases.html) (required for Kafka)
-   [Docker (optional)](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) for containerization
-   [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) for Python package management

## Installation

### 1. Get the Repository


### 2. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the following environment variables:

```env
SERVER_ADDRESS=<Your Kafka Server Address>
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Use `pip` to install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure Kafka and Zookeeper

Ensure that Kafka and Zookeeper are running. You can use Docker to set them up quickly:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### 5. Run the Microservice

Start the Flask server:

```bash
python app.py
```

The microservice will run on `http://localhost:8010`.

## API Endpoints

-   **POST /v1/ds/message** - Accepts a JSON payload with an expense message, processes it, and sends it to the Kafka topic `expense_service`.

-   **GET /** - A simple health check endpoint that returns "Hello, World".

### Example Request

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/ds/message -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"message": "Sample expense data"}'
